3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Difficulty: Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/

──────────────────────────────────────────────────

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without
duplicate characters.



Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that
"bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.

Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence
and not a substring.



Constraints:

        • 0 <= s.length <= 10^5

        • s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
