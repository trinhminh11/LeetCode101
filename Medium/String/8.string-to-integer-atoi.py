8. String to Integer (atoi)
Difficulty: Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/

──────────────────────────────────────────────────

Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a
32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

        • Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").

• Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character
is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither present.

• Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a
non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is
reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.

• Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range
[-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range.
Specifically, integers less than -2^31 should be rounded to -2^31, and
integers greater than 2^31 - 1 should be rounded to 2^31 - 1.

Return the integer as the final result.



Example 1:

Input: s = "42"

Output: 42

Explanation:

The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the
current reader position.
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading
whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor
'+')
         ^
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
           ^

Example 2:

Input: s = " -042"

Output: -42

Explanation:

Step 1: "   -042" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: "   -042" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: "   -042" ("042" is read in, leading zeros ignored in the
result)
               ^

Example 3:

Input: s = "1337c0d3"

Output: 1337

Explanation:

Step 1: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is no leading
whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is neither a '-'
nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "1337c0d3" ("1337" is read in; reading stops because the next
character is a non-digit)
             ^

Example 4:

Input: s = "0-1"

Output: 0

Explanation:

Step 1: "0-1" (no characters read because there is no leading
whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "0-1" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor
'+')
         ^
Step 3: "0-1" ("0" is read in; reading stops because the next
character is a non-digit)
          ^

Example 5:

Input: s = "words and 987"

Output: 0

Explanation:

Reading stops at the first non-digit character 'w'.



Constraints:

        • 0 <= s.length <= 200

• s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits
(0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.
